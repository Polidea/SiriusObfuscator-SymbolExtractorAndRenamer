# Check that we match some amount of brokenness w.r.t. Ninja's handling of
# inputs to phony rules.
#
# This is particularly important because CMake writes its phony rules wrong and
# writes out a cyclic dependency.
#
# Unfortunately, the way this actually works in Ninja is subtle. What happens is
# that Ninja in general does not detect a cyclic dependency except through an
# output it believes is out-of-date. Whether or not it marks a phony edge as
# out-of-date depends on how it marked the "outputs ready" flag on the inputs,
# and it sets this on the output before it iterates over the inputs.
