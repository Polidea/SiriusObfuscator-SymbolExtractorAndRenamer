This directory contains test input files for performance tests.

Currently, the included files are:

llvm-only.ninja

  This is a manifest with a structure matching that of LLVM by itself (i.e.,
  without clang), as created by using ``utils/create-dummy-ninja-fromDB`` to
  make it compact and simple. See the file itself for specific target names
  which can be used to run tests against build graphs of varying sizes which are
  isomorphic to real world use cases.

chromium-fake-manifest.ninja.gz
  This is a compressed manifest as generated by Ninja's
  ``misc/write_fake_manifests.py``, but which has been transformed to
  concatenate all of the ``subninja`` includes into one file, for ease of
  use. It is a good performance test for Ninja parsing/loading on a large real
  world test case, although it won't exercise the performance of
  ``include``/``subninja`` directives specifically.

chromium-fake-manifest.llbuild.gz
  This is the same manifest above, but transferred to use llbuild's native build
  file format. It currently is not as semantically complete as the Ninja
  version, so it isn't fair to use as a direct head to head comparison of the
  parsing performance of the two formats, but is a good large test case.
