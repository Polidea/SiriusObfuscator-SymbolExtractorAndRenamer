Note: This is in reverse chronological order, so newer entries are added to the top.

Swift 4.0
---------

* The generated Xcode project creates a dummy target which provides
  autocompletion for the manifest files. The name of the dummy target is in
  format: `<PackageName>PackageDescription`.

* `--specifier` option for `swift test` is now deprecated.
  Use `--filter` instead which supports regex.

Swift 3.0
---------

* [SE-0135](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0135-package-manager-support-for-differentiating-packages-by-swift-version.md)

  The package manager now supports writing Swift 3.0 specific tags and
  manifests, in order to support future evolution of the formats used in both
  cases while still allowing the Swift 3.0 package manager to continue to
  function.

* [SE-0129](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0129-package-manager-test-naming-conventions.md)

  Test modules now *must* be named with a `Tests` suffix (e.g.,
  `Foo/Tests/BarTests/BarTests.swift`). This name also defines the name of the
  Swift module, replacing the old `BarTestSuite` module name.

* It is no longer necessary to run `swift build` before running `swift test` (it
  will always regenerates the build manifest when necessary). In addition, it
  now accepts (and requires) the same `-Xcc`, etc. options as are used with
  `swift build`.

* The `Package` initializer now requires the `name:` parameter.
