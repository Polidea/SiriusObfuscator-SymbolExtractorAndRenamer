/// This is a general purpose solver for the problem of:
///
/// Given an input list of constraints, where each constraint identifies a
/// container and version requirements, and, where each container supplies a
/// list of additional constraints ("dependencies") for an individual version,
/// then, choose an assignment of containers to versions such that:
///
/// 1. The assignment is complete: there exists an assignment for each container
/// listed in the union of the input constraint list and the dependency list for
/// every container in the assignment at the assigned version.
///
/// 2. The assignment is correct: the assigned version satisfies each constraint
/// referencing its matching container.
///
/// 3. The assignment is maximal: there is no other assignment satisfying #1 and
/// #2 such that all assigned version are greater than or equal to the versions
/// assigned in the result.
///
/// NOTE: It does not follow from #3 that this solver attempts to give an
/// "optimal" result. There may be many possible solutions satisfying #1, #2,
/// and #3, and optimality requires additional information (e.g. a
/// prioritization among packages).
///
/// As described, this problem is NP-complete (*). This solver currently
/// implements a basic depth-first greedy backtracking algorithm, and honoring
/// the order of dependencies as specified in the manifest file. The solver uses
/// persistent data structures to manage the accumulation of state along the
/// traversal, so the backtracking is not explicit, rather it is an implicit
/// side effect of the underlying copy-on-write data structures.
///
/// The resolver will always merge the complete set of immediate constraints for
/// a package (i.e., the version ranges of its immediate dependencies) into the
/// constraint set *before* traversing into any dependency. This property allows
/// packages to manually work around performance issues in the resolution
/// algorithm by _lifting_ problematic dependency constraints up to be immediate
/// dependencies.
///
/// There is currently no external control offered by the solver over _which_
/// solution satisfying the properties above is selected, if more than one are
/// possible. In practice, the algorithm is designed such that it will
/// effectively prefer (i.e., optimize for the newest version of) dependencies
/// which are earliest in the depth-first, pre-order, traversal.
///
/// (*) Via reduction from 3-SAT: Introduce a package for each variable, with
/// two versions representing true and false. For each clause `C_n`, introduce a
/// package `P(C_n)` representing the clause, with three versions; one for each
/// satisfying assignment of values to a literal with the corresponding precise
/// constraint on the input packages. Finally, construct an input constraint
/// list including a dependency on each clause package `P(C_n)` and an
/// open-ended version constraint. The given input is satisfiable iff the input
